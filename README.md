## 🧠 Customized Marketing – Customer Segmentation with Clustering

### 🎯 Objective
To enable the bank’s marketing team to design and execute targeted marketing campaigns by grouping customers based on their spending behavior.

### 🧩 Context & Problem Statement
Traditional marketing strategies struggled due to the diverse nature of customer spending habits. The marketing team faced challenges in crafting personalized campaigns that effectively resonated with different customer segments, leading to lower engagement and conversion rates.

### 💡 Solution Approach
To address this issue, I applied **unsupervised learning techniques**, specifically `K-Means Clustering`, to segment customers based on their transactional behavior.

#### Key Steps:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and transformed transactional data, including:
  - Aggregated spend per category
  - Frequency of transactions
  - Recency metrics
- **Feature Engineering**: Generated features such as:
  - Average monthly spend
  - Number of unique categories interacted with
  - Transaction diversity score
- **Model Development**:
  - Applied the `KMeans` algorithm
  - Used the **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score** to determine the optimal number of clusters
- **Segmentation**:
  - Identified distinct customer groups (e.g., high spenders, budget-conscious shoppers, infrequent users)
- **Business Insight**:
  - Delivered detailed cluster profiles to the marketing team
  - Enabled **tailored campaigns** with relevant offers and messaging

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- `Python`
- `Pandas`
- `Scikit-learn`
- `Matplotlib`
- `Seaborn`
- `KMeans`
- `Elbow Method`
- `Silhouette Analysis`

### 📈 Impact
This customer segmentation solution empowered the marketing team to launch **data-driven, personalized campaigns**, leading to:
- Improved **customer engagement**
- Increased **conversion rates**
- Enhanced **marketing ROI**
- A foundation for future personalization initiatives (e.g., customer lifetime value, product recommendations)
