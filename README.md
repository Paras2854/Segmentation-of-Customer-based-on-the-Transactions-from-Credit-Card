Customized Marketing – Customer Segmentation with Clustering
Objective:
To enable the bank’s marketing team to design and execute targeted marketing campaigns by grouping customers based on their spending behavior.

Context & Problem Statement:
Traditional marketing strategies struggled due to the diverse nature of customer spending habits. The marketing team faced challenges in crafting personalized campaigns that effectively resonated with different customer segments, leading to lower engagement and conversion rates.

Solution Approach:
To solve this, I applied unsupervised learning techniques, specifically K-Means Clustering, to segment customers based on their transactional patterns. The project involved the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed transactional data, including aggregating spend per category, frequency of transactions, and recency metrics.

Feature Engineering: Created meaningful features like average monthly spend, number of categories interacted with, transaction diversity score, etc.

Model Development: Applied the K-Means clustering algorithm and evaluated optimal clusters using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.

Segmentation: Identified distinct customer groups (e.g., frequent high spenders, occasional shoppers, budget-conscious users) based on behavioral traits.

Business Insight: Delivered cluster profiles to the marketing team, enabling them to send tailored promotional messages and offers, significantly improving engagement and conversion rates.

Tools & Technologies Used:
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, KMeans, Elbow Method, Silhouette Analysis

Impact:
This clustering solution empowered the marketing team to run data-driven campaigns, leading to better customer engagement and a higher return on marketing investment (ROMI). It also laid the groundwork for future initiatives in personalization and customer lifetime value prediction.
